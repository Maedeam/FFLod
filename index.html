                <h2>Study of the domain</h2>
                 
              </div>
              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forugh_Farrokhzad" target="_blank"><b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b></a> was a prominent Iranian poet and filmmaker during the middle decades of the 20th century. She was an early feminist and one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran" target="_blank"><b>Iran</b></a>'s most important female characters. Although she died young, she produced 127 poems, which many critics believe make her the greatest female poet in the history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language" target="_blank"><b>Persian language</b></a> and one of the luminaries of Persian literature.</p>
              <p><b>Forugh</b> rebelled against the strictures of her conservative homeland both in her writing and her lifestyle and, as a consequence, faced widespread condemnation.</p>
              <p>She was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran" target="_blank"><b>Tehran</b></a><b>, Iran in 1935</b>, into an artist family. At the age of 16, she fell in love with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parviz_Shapour" target="_blank"><b>Parviz Shapur</b></a>, a novice writer, and married him. During these years, he published his first collection of poems, <b>The Captive</b>, and they had a son named <b>Kamiyar</b>.</p>
              <p>In <b>1954</b>, <b>Forugh</b> divorced and lost custody of her son, since both Iranian law and the fact that she was known to have committed adultery dictated that the child go to his father. Nonetheless, she apparently remained on cordial terms with her former husband. In 1956, she dedicated <b>"The Wall"</b> to him "in memory of our shared past" and with thanks for "his innumerable kindnesses."</p>
              <p><b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b> was a leading lady without supporting power, without the unity of the community, and her isolation and loneliness were both brutal and devastating, combined with the strain resulting from the collapse of her marriage, these pressures led <b>Forugh</b> to a nervous collapse in the fall of <b>1954</b>.</p>
              <p>In her most famous poetry book, <b>The Captive</b>, she declared her intention to free "the hands and feet of art from the chains of rotten conditions" and to help women "to describe what is in their heart without fear and concern for the criticism of others.". She lamented the fact that men had been able to describe their experiences of love in poetry without evoking criticism, and she insisted on her right to do the same from a feminine perspective. She published candid poetry in newspapers and magazines about her sexual adventures, including a twelve-line poem called <b>“Sin”</b> that described in explicit detail her affair with a famous magazine’s editor-in-chief: <i>“I have sinned, a delectable sin, in an embrace which was ardent, like fire.”</i></p>
              <p>In <b>1956</b>, she took her first trip abroad. During her nine-month stay in <b>Italy, Germany, and France</b>, she reveled in the freer intellectual and social environment she found there. Meanwhile, she published two other poetry collections.</p>
              <p>After <b>1958</b> until her death, she produced her finest work, which embodied an emphatic acceptance of literary modernism. <b>Forugh</b> explored her own feelings and identity as a woman in a traditional society, and her final two books of poetry show her examining society as a whole.</p>
              <p>The years after <b>1958</b> were also marked by her longstanding relationship with the great writer and filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Golestan" target="_blank"><b>Ebrahim Golestan</b></a>. As one of Iran's most prominent intellectuals, Golestan offered Forough both financial and emotional support for her work.</p>
              <p>Following a trip to <b>England</b> in <b>1959</b> to study English and filmmaking, Forugh returned to Iran to take up work as a filmmaker. For the remainder of her life, she was active as a producer, editor, and actress in various filmmaking projects. Her most prominent production was a documentary on the Iranian leper colony at Tabriz, <a href="https://archive.org/details/vimeo-136522352" target="_blank"><b>The House is Black</b></a>, which she filmed in <b>1962</b>.</p>
              <p><b>Another Birth</b>, a collection of 35 poems published by <b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b> in <b>1964</b>, established her as a significant figure in Iranian literature. <b>Forugh</b> herself considered <b>Another Birth</b> as a sign of her growth as a writer. By <b>1965</b>, she had gained enough international recognition for UNESCO to produce a film about her life. Unfortunately, <b>Forugh</b> died on February 14, <b>1967</b>, from injuries sustained in a car accident.</p>
              <p>A posthumous collection of her work, <b>Let Us Believe in the Beginning of the Cold Season</b>, was published in <b>1972</b>. This collection introduced new themes, such as loneliness and death, into her writing. <b>Forugh</b>'s passion for exploring the world through her poetry was expressed in a letter to her last lover, <b>Ebrahim Golestan</b>: <i>"I want to pierce everything and penetrate into all things. I want to reach the depths of the earth."</i></p>
              <p>In addition to her professional success, <b>Forugh</b>'s independent lifestyle makes her a role model for Iranian women. She lived without relying on any men for support and praised women's subjectivity and freedom. She opposed the Middle Eastern concept of veiled women at home, but she also rejected the Western ideal of women as mere objects of beauty. <b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b> was a living poem, exemplifying the eternal beauty of a divine woman by living her truth.</p>
              <p><b>Forugh</b> expressed her desire to see a better world in a poignant statement: <i>"I wish I could die and be reborn to see that the world has changed. That it's not as cruel anymore, and people have lost their general miserliness, and nobody marks their house with fences."</i></p>

          <p>The main topic of my project is <b>Forough Farrokhzad</b>. The chosen <b>items</b> are all relevant in order to tell the facts about her story.
            The purpose of this conceptual map is to represent the <b>extracted data</b>, all in natural language. This step represents data as extracted from the choosen 10 <b>items</b> and also the relationips between them.
            All <font color="#009B77"><b>greean nodes</b></font> in the graph represent the <font color="#009B77"><b>items</b></font>, while <font color="#31bddf"><b>blue nodes</b></font> represent important <font color="#31bddf"><b>events, places and people</b></font> related to the main subject.

    <h2>Metadata Analysis</h2>
    <p>The table below shows the metadata standards used by the institutions to describe the selected items. Some of them explicitly declared the standard(s) used for the data they manipulated, while for those not declared, the common standards most related to the element provided were chosen. All standards allow computational modeling, helping mediate through different cultural heritage sources. All standards refer to cultural works.
      <p>      The <b>documentary</b> hosted by <b>Imdb-online</b> informative database links television series, home video and television content online- we chose to use <b>Schema.org</b> because it is an appropriate schemas to deal with cinematographic items. Regarding the <b>bibliography</b>, it was under the <b>Internet archive institution</b>, it followed<b> MARC standard</b>. 
        <p>As for Trotsky and Kahlo photography, the representation of <b>Wikimedia Commons</b> doesn’t follow any specific standard, hence we chose <b>CIDOC-CRM</b> suited for archival data. The <b>portrait</b> of Frida Kahlo is held by the <b>MET Museum</b>: an institution that adopts the <b>CCRel license properties</b>, but enhanced through <b>Getty vocabularies</b>; for this reason we selected <b>CDWA</b> to be the fittest standard. The <b>Ted Educational Video</b> is present both on <b>Youtube and Ted-Talk</b>: these institutions don’t follow any specific standard, but we decided to opt for the highly general <b>Dublin Core</b> standard. </p>
        <p>The <b>Diary</b> is both an <b>exhibition</b> and an object itself, we chose the exhibition as an item event, being hosted on <b>Google Arts and Culture</b>, the museum "La casa Azul" did not have a standard, so we chose to adopt <b>CCO- Catalogue for Cultural Objects</b>: content standard for the descriptionof works of art, architecture and material culture. Its attempt is that of meeting the needs of both usual resources and museum communities. </p> 
          <p>The <b>letter</b> held by the <b>American Archive of Arts</b>, but we could not find their used metadata standard, so we decided to use the <b>MARC standard</b> to represent it; while the museum represented by <b>ISNII</b> follows <b>Marc21</b>.</p>
        <p>As for the <b>Article</b> we e-mailed <b>ICAA</b> to know their adopted standard, they were under the supervision of <b>Getty vocabularies</b> for property choices, so we decided to adopt <b>CDWA</b>. </p>
      </p>
      <p>The order of <b>metadata standards</b> is equal to their relevancy to the project.
      In order to display the standards we retrieved ourselves we have displayed them with a (*).</p>
       <ul>
         <li>1. <b>SCHEMA.ORG</b>: a collaborative activity that creates and maintains schema for structured data for the Web. Founded by Google and Microsoft, it constitutes a shared vocabulary for extensible experiences.</li>
         <li>2. <b>Dublin Core</b>: allows the bridging of established metadata and graph-based solutions for integration across data within a Linked Data ecosystem. Made up of 15 metadata elements, it offers expanded cataloging information and improved indexing for search engine programs.
      </li>
      <li>3. <b>CIDOC-CRM</b> CIDOC-CRM - Conceptual Reference Model, it is a theoretical as well as a practical tool to extend and integrate cultural heritage information. Allows the retrieval of specific data points. It defines concepts and relationships essential for the analysis of Cultural Heritage materials.
      </li>
      <li>4. <b>CDWA/CCO</b> Categories for the Description of Works of Art. It is a data standard of art and its disciplines. This core offers a conceptual framework for retrieving information. It can be used to map data, identify issues, and openly link data.
      </li>
      <li>5. <b>MARC/MARC21</b>. A MARCXML standard, offering detailed descriptions of data elements, enriched with historic sections.
      </li>
      <li>6. <b>CCO: Cataloguing Cultural Objects</b>. This guide is the first data content standard specifically intended for cataloging cultural heritage material. Following the development of metadata sets such as CDWA and Dublin Core, CCO syntax guides the choice of terms for ordering data. Cataloging of all cultural works: paintings, sculptures, objects of material culture, architecture/built works, installation art, performance art, manuscripts, photographs, and prints.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>1. The Science Museum Group's collection information and access policy of October 2018, reports: "For archive collections, SMG will meet the requirements of ISAD(g): General International Standard Archival Description (International Council on Archives, 2007)".

    2. Wikimedia Commons does not clearly specify the standard used, so I decided to refer to the one indicated, considering it suitable for the type of item.

    3. The "Strategy and bibliographic standards" section shows a table that provides an overview of the main metadata standards followed by the Library for describing its collections: https://www.bl.uk/collection-metadata/strategy-and-standards.

    4. Wikimedia Commons does not clearly specify the standard used, however the item in question comes from the Houghton Library (Harvard University), so I decided to refer to the standard used by the Harvard Library, of which the Houghton is a part. https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/LibraryStaffDoc/LibraryCloud+Metadata.

    5. IMDB does not clearly specify the standard used, so I decided to refer to the one indicated, considering it suitable for the type of item.

    <p>After having found the linked institutions and corresponding standard, this last fundamental step allows the final description and <b>interconnection</b> between items. The whole purpose of this project was to adopt <b>shared semantic ontologies</b> in order to deliver <b>coherent data</b>.
      <ul>The final adopted standards:</ul>
      <li>1. <b>Dublin Core</b> <i>: dcterms</i>. Applied over most standards, for its core relevancy. </li>
